# EDDI Commons Machine #

A little commons library for the projects related to the EDDI programming language. 

## Building ##

To build the library, you can use make

    $ git clone git://github.com/wichtounet/eddivm.git
    $ cd eddivm
    $ make

That will create a libeddi-commons.so file into the bin directory. You then have to install it in your system so that it can be used by other programs. 

## Troubleshooting ##

Please consider using [Github issues tracker](http://github.com/wichtounet/eddi-commons/issues) to submit bug reports or feature requests. You can also contact me via my [website](http://baptiste-wicht.com/).
